\title{Factorial Function (factorial)}
\usage{
myfactorial(n)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A non-negative integer for which the factorial will be computed.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the factorial of `n`.
}
\description{
Computes the factorial of a non-negative integer \( n \), defined as:
\deqn{ n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdots \times 1 }
}
\details{
The factorial function is commonly used in combinatorics, probability theory, and algebra. It represents the number of ways to arrange n distinct objects in a sequence. The function is defined for non-negative integers, and the result grows rapidly as n increases.


The factorial of a non-negative integer is the product of all integers from 1 to n. The factorial function has important applications in combinatorics (e.g., permutations and combinations), calculus (e.g., Taylor series), and probability theory (e.g., binomial coefficients).

Special case:
\deqn{0! = 1}

For large values of \(n\), the function is implemented using a numerically stable method that may involve logarithmic approximations.
